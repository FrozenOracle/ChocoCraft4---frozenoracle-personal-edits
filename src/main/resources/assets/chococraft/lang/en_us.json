    "gui.chocobook.page2": "So I guess you're wondering now, how the hell do I tame a Chocobo? Well, that's easy, to tame a Chocobo you must find green gysahls to feed them, which spawn all over the world; Can't get it to love you? Shove some more gysahls in, it'll work!",
    "gui.chocobook.page3": "So, how do I ride it? Sometimes Chocobos will drop a unique feather, combine this with a normal saddle to make a Chocobo saddle, and right click the Chocobo to put it on. Maybe you can make a better saddle, one with storage or something.",
    "gui.chocobook.page4": "So you have a plain Chocobo, that's great but you can do better. Using a Chocopedia on a Chocobo will let you unlock new abilities by using the experience that you have, which will drain from your soul. This includes Flying, Gliding, Sprinting, and Diving.",
    "gui.chocobook.page5": "Neat, so I unlocked an ability, how do I use it? To fly you must sprint to gain momentum then jump, gliding is literally just falling slower, to sprint press the sprint key (immersion broken sadface,) to dive literally just jump in water.",
    "gui.chocobook.page6": "I have a Chocobo, but I want MOOR! Okay, so there's a mommy and daddy Chocobo, the daddy has colored feathers, get them to boop by feeding both a lovely gysahl which is gained rarely by farming gysahls; Put the egg in a nest, and with enough time and space, it will hatch.",
    "gui.chocobook.page7": "Help, my Chocobos pooped out a worse Chocobo! That's okay, there's a chance your new baby will be worse in some ways, but most of the time you'll get a faster, healthier, and more energetic Chocobo than the previous generation. Just keep trying!"
